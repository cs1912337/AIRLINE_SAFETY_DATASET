# AIRLINE_SAFETY_DATASET

**Dataset Overview**

The Airline Safety dataset provides detailed records of airline safety performance across multiple airlines globally, spanning various time periods. It includes data on incidents, fatal accidents, and fatalities, alongside operational metrics such as available seat kilometers and aircraft types. This dataset is valuable for analyzing trends in aviation safety, comparing airline performance, and assessing regional or aircraft-specific safety records.

**Key Features**

**Time Periods:**

Data is divided into two distinct periods: 1985-1999 and 2000-2014, enabling comparative analysis over time.

**Safety Metrics:**

Includes incidents, fatal accidents, and fatalities for each time period.

**Operational Metrics:**

The column avail_seat_km_per_week provides a quantitative measure of each airline's operational scale.

**Regional and Aircraft-Specific Data:**

The dataset includes geographical regions and aircraft types to enable specific analyses.

**Duplicate Entries:**

Some airlines appear multiple times with different years or aircraft types.
